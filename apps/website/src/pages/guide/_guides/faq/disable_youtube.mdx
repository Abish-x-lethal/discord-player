# Disabling YouTube Playback

Streaming from youtube is against YouTube's terms of service. A lot of Discord Bots have been banned for streaming from YouTube. If you want to avoid getting banned, you should disable YouTube playback in your bot. Discord Player supports YouTube playback as long as you have Youtube Extractor registered. You can disable YouTube playback by not registering the Youtube Extractor.

Do not use

```js
await player.extractors.loadDefault();
```

as it loads all the extractors. Instead, manually register the extractors you need.

```js
import { SoundCloudExtractor, SpotifyExtractor } from '@discord-player/extractor';

await player.extractors.register(SoundCloudExtractor, {});
await player.extractors.register(SpotifyExtractor, {});
// add more if needed
```

You can also disable YouTube extractor while using `await player.extractors.loadDefault();`.

```js
import { Player } from 'discord-player';
import { YouTubeExtractor } from '@discord-player/extractor';

const player = new Player(client, {
    blockStreamFrom: [
        // now your bot will no longer be able to use
        // youtube extractor to play audio even if the track was
        // extracted from youtube
        YouTubeExtractor.identifier
    ],
    blockExtractors: [
        // this will block the listed extractors from being
        // able to query metadata (aka search results parsing)
        // This example disables youtube search
        YouTubeExtractor.identifier
    ]
});
```

## Disable YouTube bridging

Extractors like `SpotifyExtractor` and `AppleMusicExtractor` fall back to youtube streaming. In order to prevent this behavior, you can set a custom bridge source that points to `SoundCloud` instead.

```js
import { BridgeProvider, BridgeSource } from '@discord-player/extractor';

const bridgeProvider = new BridgeProvider(BridgeSource.SoundCloud);

const player = new Player(client, {
    bridgeProvider
});
```

In order to use `SoundCloud` as the `BridgeProvider` source, you need to register the `SoundCloudExtractor` first. See <Link className="text-teal-500 hover:underline" href="/guide/extractors/setting-bridge-source">Setting Bridge Source</Link> for more information.
