# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Cannot find opusscript or @discordjs/opus or node-opus

To resolve this issue, you need to install the opus encoder. Use one of the following commands based on your preference:

```sh
$ yarn add @discordjs/opus
# or
$ yarn add opusscript
# or
$ yarn add node-opus
```

## FFmpeg/Avconv not found

Ensure that you have either `FFmpeg` or `Avconv` available on your system.

### Installing FFmpeg or Avconv

> We do not recommend using static binaries like `ffmpeg-static` as they are not always up-to-date or stable and may cause issues.

You have several options to get FFmpeg:

- Download it from the official FFmpeg website: [www.ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- Use the Node Module (ffmpeg-static): [npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static](https://npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) (Note: Using static binaries like `ffmpeg-static` is not recommended)
- Alternatively, if you prefer using Avconv instead of FFmpeg, install it on your system or place the Avconv executable at the root of your project.

## Audio player stops immediately without errors

This issue is most likely caused by the usage of static binaries like `ffmpeg-static`. We do not recommend using static binaries as they are not always up-to-date or stable and may cause issues. To fix this issue, make sure to install FFmpeg or Avconv on your system.

## Audio player stops after about 30 seconds to 1 minute without errors

This issue is most likely caused by outdated version of `@discordjs/voice`. Make sure you are using the latest version of `@discordjs/voice` and `discord-player`.

## "Something" is not working

If you encounter issues and something isn't functioning correctly, try attaching a `debug` listener to `player.events` to check for any unusual behavior.

If you receive peculiar errors such as "something is not a constructor" or "version.split is not a function" or similar, follow these steps:

1. If you are using `npm`, remove `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, or any lockfiles you have. Then, run `npm cache clean --force`, or use a similar command for your package manager, and finally run `npm install` (or the install command of your package manager).
2. If the above step does not resolve the issue, consider using another package manager like `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`.
