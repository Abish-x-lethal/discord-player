# Migrating to Discord Player v6

## Before you start
> **Note**  
> v6 is currently in development and is actively being worked on. No updates will be made to v5.4.0 going forward. To start using v6 before full release you can install all the necessary components using:  
> `npm i discord-player@dev @discord-player/utils@dev @discord-player/equalizer@dev @discord-player/extractor@dev`

v6 requires Discord.js 14.0 or higher. PLease make sure you have a compatible version using `npm list discord.js` in your terminal. If you're using an earlier version please update it. There are resources to help with that on the [Discord.JS Guide](https://discordjs.guide/).
We have introduced some breaking changes in Discord Player v6 so your old code will no longer work without making the necessary changes.

### New queue system and Player singleton

The old `Queue` is deprecated and is replaced with `GuildQueue` which is similar to `Queue` but handles things in a better way.

You can now create a `Player.singleton(client)` to avoid polluting your client and in order to be able to access the player instance anywhere in your code.

## Commonly used methods that changed

### Queue Creation Changes
Discord Player `player.play` will handle queue creation, search results, tracks queuing, and the playing functionality for simpler user experience.
```diff
- player.createQueue(guild, {
-  autoSelfDeaf: true,
-  initialVolume: 80,
-  leaveOnEmpty: true,
-  leaveOnEmptyCooldown: 300000,
-  leaveOnEnd: true,
-  leaveOnEndCooldown: 300000,
- });
- queue.play();

+ player.play(channel, result, {
+  nodeOptions: {
+   metadata: {
+    channel: interaction.channel,
+    client: interaction.guild.members.me,
+    requestedBy: interaction.user,
+   },
+   autoSelfDeaf: true,
+   initialVolume: 80,
+   leaveOnEmpty: true,
+   leaveOnEmptyCooldown: 300000,
+   leaveOnEnd: true,
+   leaveOnEndCooldown: 300000,
+  },
+ });
```

### Player Changes
The main changes to the Player class are outlined below. The caching is used for . Several [filter additions](#filters) were made as well.

```diff
- player.on('event')
+ player.events.on('event')

+ player.singleton(client, options);
Note: parameters can be omitted after initial use to get the singleton.

- player.search(query, options);
+ player.search changes

# TODO somestuff for cache? maybe in additions section

- onBeforeCreateStream();
Note: it was only used when you wanted to use play-dl. Now you only need play-dl installed.

+ onAfterCreateStream()
Note: this is used for post processing PCM stream.
// Maybe move to additions section
```

### Queue Changes
Several aspects of the queue have changed, the most notable one is 
`getQueue()` which has been moved into `nodes.get()`. The changes are all listed below and were done as a way to improve the queue system while following a modular approach.

```diff
- player.getQueue(guildId);
+ player.nodes.get(guildId);

- queue.clear();
+ queue.tracks.clear();

- queue.destroy();
+ player.nodes.delete(guildId);

- queue.current;
+ queue.currentTrack;

- queue.setPaused(true); // still functional
+ queue.node.pause();

- queue.setPaused(false); // still functional
+ queue.node.resume();

- queue.shuffle();
+ queue.tracks.shuffle();

- queue.remove(trackNum);
+ queue.node.remove(trackNum);

- queue.skip();
+ queue.node.skip();

- queue.skipTo(trackNum);
+ queue.skipTo(trackNum);

- queue.playing;
+ queue.node.isPlaying();

- queue.tracks.length; 
+ queue.tracks.size
but can be retrieved with:
+ queue.getSize();

+ queue.isEmpty();

+ queue.node.isPaused();

- queue.addTracks();
Note: although this was removed, queue.addTrack() now works with both single tracks and playlists

- queue.setFilters({ bassboost: !queue.getFiltersEnabled().includes('bassboost') })
+ queue.filters.ffmpeg.toggle('bassboost')

- queue.back()
+ queue.history.back()
```

### Event Changes
Events are now emitted from `player.events` object. [Here are the list of possible events](https://discord-player.netlify.app/docs/types/discord-player/GuildQueueEvents).

// TODO: add diff if there are any changes

## New Additions

### Filters
There are several new filter options shown below. The 8D filter used is **not** the one in FFmpeg and you will see it applied immediately unlike the FFmpeg one.

```diff
Filters like LowPass, HighPass, LowShelf, HighShelf, AllPass, etc:
+ player.filters.biquad.setFilter(BiquadFilterType.LowPass)

Equalizer
+ player.filters.equalizer.setEQ(EqualizerConfigurationPreset.Jazz)

or similar to lavalink
+ player.filters.equalizer.setEQ([{ band: 0, gain: 0.25 }])

DSP Filters
+ player.filters.filters.setFilters(['8D'])
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I reply to the event like v5?

v6 still supports v5's `metadata` object:

```js
const queue = player.nodes.create(message.guild, {
    metadata: message
});
```

The metadata `message` will always be available in every event emitted for that specific `Queue`. You can access it via `queue.metadata`:

```js
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
    const channel = queue.metadata.channel; // queue.metadata is your "message" object
    channel.send(`ðŸŽ¶ | Started playing **${track.title}**`);
});
```

### How do I stop the player

You have to use `<Queue>.delete()` to destroy the queue. It will also stop the player.

```js
const queue = player.nodes.get(guildId);
if (!queue.deleted) queue.delete();
```
